## Node Youtube-dl Link API ##
##### A simple project by Simon Cheng. Special thanks to the awesome library [youtube-dl driver for node](https://github.com/przemyslawpluta/node-youtube-dl) #####
Hi everyone! This is a program that **only gets high quality videos.** It's only because it's more convenient for myself and others who want use it.

Anyway, to run the program, be sure you have a node version higher than 8.
```
node version
```
If not, than install it from the official website, or use a really neat tool: [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To install all neccessary libraries:
```
npm install
```
And finally to run the program:
```
node index.js
```
Fire up a web browser and go to
```
http://localhost:8080
```
__The port above may be different! Check the console for details!__
Lastly, to access the api portion of the program, this is the url scheme:
```
http://localhost:8080/api?url=YOUTUBE_URL
```

Enjoy :)
